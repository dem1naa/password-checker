Created tool for checking passwords if they have been breached
using HBIP Password API. Fisrt I wrote the code using bash
in Linux terminal next I decided to create GUI with python.
after all I changed .py file to .exe

How to use it:
Open tool and write any password. 
it will save the log file in the directory where the app is.
